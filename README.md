# 283-4

For each member in your team, provide 1 paragraph detailing what parts of the lab that member 
implemented / researched.
-Individualy work

What did you learn from the count of exits? Was the count what you expected? If not, why not?
-Shadow paging (Ept set to 0) has more exits than nested paging (ept)). It's what I expected. Exits: CR3 exits, Page Fault Exits and TLB Flush exits

What changed between the two runs (ept vs no-ept)?
-The number of exits in NO-EPT is more than exits in EPT Mode. Shadow paging(ept = o) has more exits than nested paging(ept).
